"""Regenerate the root index, version list and .nojekyll of the docs site.

The published docs are one directory per version, each built once when its ref
is pushed and never rebuilt. Nothing that lives inside a version directory can
therefore describe the set of versions -- 2.7.0's pages were written before
3.0.0 existed. So the shared state lives at the site root instead, and this
script rewrites it from whatever directories are actually present after a
deploy has synced its own:

  versions.json  read at page load by the sidebar picker (doc/_templates)
  index.html     redirects the site root to the newest release
  .nojekyll      stops GitHub Pages running Jekyll, which silently discards
                 the _static/ and _sources/ directories Sphinx emits

Directories are ordered master first, then releases newest first, then anything
else alphabetically. Only a non-prerelease version is ever a redirect target,
so a throwaway or prerelease deploy is listed but never becomes the landing
page.

Usage: gen_docs_index.py <site-dir>
