"""Flag comment blocks and docstrings that have grown too long.

Long prose next to code tends to accumulate history --- what an earlier version
did, what was measured once, why an alternative was dropped --- that no longer
helps someone reading the code as it is. This check does not judge content; it
finds the longest blocks so they can be reviewed and cut back.

Two limits:

* a comment block is a run of consecutive full-line ``#`` comments (a blank
  line ends it; a trailing comment after code does not count), limited to
  ``--max-comment`` lines;
* a docstring is that of a function, method or class, or an attribute
  docstring (a string statement straight after an assignment, as used for
  dataclass fields and module constants), limited to ``--max-docstring``
  lines. Module docstrings are exempt.

Only a docstring's prose counts. Counting stops at the first numpy-style
reference section --- ``Parameters``, ``Returns`` and the like, a header
underlined with dashes --- because a thoroughly documented argument list is
not what this is looking for. ``Notes`` is prose and still counts.

Lines are counted from the opening line inclusive.
